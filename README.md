Howdy Y'all!

We're the BUSrTransit team! If you just want a runnable version of the project, we've included a runnable JAR file in our repo. We run our code in eclipse by importing the folders under the BUSrTransitDocs/BUSrTransit/ into the src folder of a new java project. You can load in your own routes, users, and messages for testing in csv file format. 
A MySQL version of the project is available under the BUSrTransitDB folder.
